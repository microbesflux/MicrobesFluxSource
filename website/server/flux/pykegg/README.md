PyKEGG: A Python Library for Understanding KEGG KGML Files.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

PyKEGG is under construction.

Phase I of our goal is to extract all KEGG related functionalities from
MicrobesFlux's parser logic into an independent library.

Phase II is to improve PyKEGG such that it supports most of the use cases
on KGML files.
