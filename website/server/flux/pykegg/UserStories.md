Here is a list of user stories we collected after talking to several biology researchers.

As a biological researcher,
	 * I would like to be able to get metabolic information from the KGML (metabolic pathway maps) file. 
	 * I would like to see the substrate and product information of a reaction.
	 * I would like to verify that all reactions are balanced (especially for custom add reaction).
	 * I would like to see the enzyme information related to a reaction.
	 * I would like to see the metabolic network of the organism.
	 * I would like to see the up/down regulate information of a gene to an enzyme/reaction.
	 * I would like to see all possible routes from one metabolites to another.
	 * I would like to see the related metabolites, stoichiometric and other related info.
	 * I would like to be able to edit the KGML file to add/remove certain pathways, but I donot want to edit the XML file directly.
	 * I would like to see the annotated metabolic flux map of a species.
	 * I would like to get the detailed information of a specific pathway. For instance, path:hsa04660 (T cell receptor signaling pathway - Homo sapiens (human). 
	 * I would like to have a comparison map of metabolic pathway among several different species (e.g., the same parts and different parts on metabolic pathway)
